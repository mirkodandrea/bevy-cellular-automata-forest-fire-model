# Bevy-life Forest Fire Model

This is a simple implementation of the forest fire model in Bevy. The model is based on the paper "Forest Fires: An Example of Self-Organized Critical Behavior" by Drossel and Schwabl.

The model simulates a forest in which trees can be in one of three states: empty, occupied by a tree, or on fire. The model is updated in discrete time steps.

To run the model, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release
```
